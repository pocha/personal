Made a basic UI, with forms , tabs, and generating charts.\r\n\r\nAt this point of time, the theme was non compliant, the forms needed more tweaking, and IE was having issues with early initialization and generation of all charts.\r\n\r\nThe following are then things that are going on:\r\n\r\n1. How to nicely fit huge descriptions into a form , which has more than 30 fields in one page.\r\n2. Php script to receive all form varialbes and dump them into respective files\r\n3. Trying out late implimentation and generation of charts for IE.This may be a bit irritating for the user, as each time clicking on navigation will need a chart generation first, but might just work for IE.\r\n\r\nProgress Report 2 :\r\n\r\nThe Process:\r\n\r\n1. Clearly, this project needed a lot of generation of dynamic elements, starting from tabs, which were to be populated with forms, which when submitted , would create a set of charts ,to be read from files, dynamically generated from the server.\r\n\r\n2.It was much more logical to create methods for creation of GUI Elements, so the first thing that was done was , only provide the bear neceseties, like the CSS and a basic skeleton to the HTML, and leave the generation of everything on the page to javascript\r\n\r\n3.The function are such that, all they need is the data to be filled in, and they will create forms. charts, tabs, pretty much everything the user will see on the screen , dynamically.\r\n\r\n4.Combined to the above, all this was needed to be done on one single page.No refreshes.\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\n\r\nLibraries I have used :\r\n\r\n1. jquery : jquery.com/\r\n2. jquery form plugin : jquery.malsup.com/form/\r\n3. jquery validation plugin docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation\r\n4. self built libraries\r\n\r\nDetails :\r\n\r\nSelf Build Libraries:\r\n\r\nFile :nativaCode.js\r\n\r\ncreateSelectFormField(‚Äútitle1‚Äù,[optionsArray1],[enabledArray1],‚Äùtitle2‚Äù,[optionsArray2],[enabledArray2]) :\r\nThis function takes care of create form fields like the ones in Data Set 2 (Bdata).Which have a drop down list.The optionsArray is the array of the options, and the enabledArray is an array which corresponds to which options are enabled.\r\nThis function in turn calls getSelectBox(title,optionsArray,enabledArray), which basically return the HTML which has to be embedded into the DOM.\r\n\r\ngetFormField(label,index,dataSet) :\r\nThis function create form fields like the ones in Dataset 1 (a) and Dataset 3(q).\r\nThe index shows , which position the value related to this field occurs in the data files (Adata.txt and Qdata.txt).\r\nE.g ‚ÄúNum Points‚Äù is a value related to Data set 3(QData)  and occurs at the second position in the file.\r\nSo a call to getFormField(\"Num points\" , 2 ,\'q\') will get you a form field, which will dump its data in Qdata.txt at the second position.\r\n\r\n\r\nshowChild(i) :Shows the related chart number.(i)\r\n\r\nIsNumeric (number) :Tells if a number in passed is numeric or not.\r\n\r\nvalidateAllFields() :\r\nCall this and it will first validate all possible fields, and if there are any violations , will show a popup box, telling the user what all data is missing.\r\n\r\nshowModal () :\r\nThis function is the magic box, where all the data is sent to the server, all charts are generated , all validation is done, and finally the user gets to see the data after calling this function.\r\nNOTE: Calling this function more than once, is not suggested.Call this function , only when you want the data to be generated and charts to be shown\r\n\r\npopulateChartWithFile(Title,XLabel,YLable,FilesArray,LegendsArray):\r\nThis is the function which really takes care of downloading a data from the generated file(from python), and converting it into charts.\r\nThe number of line series (graphs) on a chart will be equal to the number of files in FilesArray.\r\n\r\ne.g\r\npopulateChartWithFile(\"Time (s)\",  ?

As project creator has mentioned, stick to 1.5 or 2.1 version of platform, we say the same. Just dont use the 3.0 version. It did not work for us. Quite a few first timers were stuck here for quite sometime</li>\r\n	<li>For the naive java programmers like us, we realized that Activity name should match the Class name of your main function. For example - if you specified HelloAndroid as Activity name in Eclipse while creating the project, you also made sure that the main file & function is named HelloAndroid.java & HelloAndroid respectively</li>\r\n	<li>There are chances that you would be hit with most frustrating run-time errors - the app quit unexpectedly. LogCat is the real savior in those situation.
