						<td><h3> You decide the project cost</h3>
						<p> Decide the cost of your project to what seems the best to you. Usually if the project price is at par with market standards it fetches the best and maximum ninja response.</p></td>

						<td><h3> You decide the project duration</h3>
						<p> Decide the duration you feel could be apt for your project. If ninjas feel time is less than required they will raise queries on discussion board and you are free to discuss further with them.</p></td>

							<p>Time & again people have asked us - why 15% man ? To them we respond this way</p>

								<li>Project moderation & acting as second point of contact. We make sure both parties respond to each other on time. In the event of conflict, we mediate & settle the same.</li>
								<li>Project refinement - we spend quite a bit of time refining the projects. If we cant understand the project ourselves, we do not expect a college student to understand it either</li>
								<li>We hold project money with us till the work gets done (escrow). This is to make sure that both parties stay focussed on the job & not on money.</li>
								<li>We propagate your project to reach more than 5000 college developers/hackers. We post it to various google, facebook & linkedin groups we are part of.</li>
								<li>We personally follow-up with the right match Ninjas to make sure your project gets picked up. If we feel that your project requires skills which is absent in our system, we reach out to the right segment to get your project takers.</li>

		<h3>Conditions</h3>
		<li>1. The premium needs to be paid before we start propagating your project. We need an assurance from the project creator that they have vested interest & they timely check the task solution submitted by Ninjas.</li>
		<li>2. We would refund the premium if no student is able to complete the project's task. No refund would be done otherwise.</li>
		<li>3. You can either choose to deposit premium & project money at the outset or you do so while selecting a Ninja. We would refund the project budget amount if you wish to cancel the project anytime before you select a Ninja.</li>
