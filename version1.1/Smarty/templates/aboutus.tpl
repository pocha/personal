			  <h3>The Story</h3>
				<div class="para">
			  Stalkninja is a result of talks with startups and SME who had problems getting jobs done remotely and hiring intern doesnot work round the year. We are trying to evolve the product when education sector is on boom in india and students are willing to get industry exposure much before they leave the college.
				<br/><br/>
				Working on his previous startup Minkle, Pocha felt need for simple hiring solution where to get his non core tech jobs done and was helped by couple of students who quickly did it for him.
				<br/><br/>Moving ahead he started to develop a simpler, affordable ecosystem which supports students learning and helps startups with day-to-day stuffs. A model which doesn't tries too many things but – still is win win for both student and company.
