<p><b>What is StalkNinja?</b></p>

<p class="para">Stalk Ninja is a student freelance portal where people can float there tech jobs to be done by college student freelancers. Project creator can select a student(we call them Ninja) for his project & get project done. All projects are paid projects.</p>

<h3>For people looking to float a project</h3>
<div class="para">
<p><b>1. How is it different from other freelance sites?</b></p>

<p class="para">
	<ol>
		<li>The takers are college students who are cost-effective than regular freelancers.</li>
		<li>Being a non-professional, they need to complete the task in the project to proove they can do the project.</li>
		<li>Unlike the bidding process, the project creator decide the project budget & duration. We review each project that is floated for clarity of description, feasibility of deliverables/task and appropriateness of budget & duration.</li>
		<li>We propagate the word of your project to more than 5000 college hackers/developers.</li>
		<li>We monitor each project to make sure both parties stay fair to each other. We have personal connect on both sides so that both parties work in a trusted environment.</li>
		<li>Lastly, we hold the money till the project gets completed.</li>
	</ol><br/>
		Well, quite a few differentiators we think :).</p>


<p><b>4. How do I decide project budget/duration?</b></p>

<p class="para">You are free to come up with a budget/duration. Typically a project spanning 5-7 days of work would cost Rs 2-3k. Once a project is submitted we review it to for appropriate deliverables, budget and timeline. If budget is too low or too high we assist you in deciding the apt value. Usually if budget is as per market standards then it fetches best ninjas and maximum responses.
</p>

<p><b>5. I am unable to understand 'Task' on the project floating page?</b></p>

<p class="para">Task is usually a small but the trickiest part of project that you can use to filter out the correct ninjas for your project. Ninjas will solve the task and paste link of solution on project discussion board, you can check the guy with the best task solution & choose him to complete project. We suggest you to check the task of previous projects to get an idea.</p>

<p><b>5. When should I pay for the project?</b></p>
<p class="para">Once we approve the project & intimate you, you would need to deposit project premium (15% of project budget) with us. You can choose to deposit complete project amount & premium in a single go, else you need to deposit the project amount before the selected Ninja starts the work. We would refund you the project amount if you choose to cancel the project before selecting a Ninja. We would also refund you the premium if the project do not get any taker.</p>

<p><b>6. I have floated project, what next?</b></p>

<p class="para">Ones a project is floated our admin panel will review the project and send you a confirmation mail with details about how the project payment is to be done and any suggestions if needed in the project. After you deposit the project money, we intimate ninjas and they work on project to grab project.</p>

<p><b>7. I don't want to share complete project details, how can I float project?</b></p>

<p class="para">If you don't want to share your complete project details, simply give any brief about project while floating project and give a task to filter best ninjas for you. Mail us the complete project details and we will share it via a google doc between you and selected ninja only.</p>

<p><b>8. What about code quality, bugs etc ?</b></p>
<p class="para">Ideally, if you are asking for a enhancement, the Ninja can look at the existing code before extending. If your work is modular, there is a high probablity that work done by him would be modular. If the project involve coding from scratch, you can pass a high level design to which the Ninja needs to stick. You are free to report bugs or ask for code changes provided it stays within the scope of deliverables of the project.</p>

<p><b>9. What if the project does not get complete within the duration? </b></p>
<p class="para">We are very strict about the project duration. If the Ninja is not able to complete the project within the duration, he faces monetary penalty in terms of reduced payment. Please make sure that you factor in enough time for bug reporting as the Ninja is not allowed to work beyond the duration & it could mean incomplete work.</p>

<p><b>10. What if the selected Ninja stops responding or erratic in reporting.</b></p>
<p class="para">We monitor all projects & are aware of development. In case of non-reporting, the Ninja is moved out of the project & we re-open the project for takers. Also, we have personal connect with all the Ninjas, so we follow-up with them in case they do not report on time.</p>

<p><b>3. Why only web/mobile/IT projects are listed on Stalk Ninja?</b></p>
<p class="para">The projects are floated by companies/startups/individuals & not us. Most of the IT work can be done in a remote enviroment & hence there are more IT related projects.</p>
