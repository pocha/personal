			 <br/><br/> <br/>At StalkNinja, we take the privacy of our members very seriously. Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about how we treat personally identifiable information. We provide this Privacy Policy because you have a right to know what information we collect, how it is protected and used, and the circumstances under which it may be disclosed. If you have comments, suggestions, questions, or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us via email at admin@stalkninja.com.
<br/><br/><b>Online Privacy Standards.</b> While there are no official standards governing privacy practices on the internet, we follow the principles supported by the Federal Trade Commission's Fair Information Practices Principles, currently available at http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.htm
<br/><br/><b>What This Policy Covers.</b> This policy covers StalkNinja's treatment of personally identifiable information that we obtain when you visit our website, subscribe to StalkNinja, or become a member of StalkNinja. We regard personally identifiable information as information that someone can use to identify or contact you in person, such as real name, telephone number, email address, or physical mailing address. Information that we use internally to identify you as a member in our system, such as your selected username, is not considered personally identifiable information.
<br/><br/><b>What This Policy Does Not Cover.</b> This policy does not cover the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, such as our partners and ninjas. In addition, we may provide links to other services and on occasion to other sites that may interest you. All of these sites operate independently of StalkNinja and they have their own privacy or security practices. For your best on-line experience, we encourage you to review their policies before submitting any personal information to them.
<br/><br/><b>1. Information You Provide.</b>
<br/><br/><b>Required Registration Information.</b> During the registration process, we collect your email address and contact number. We will send you an email to verify that you are the owner of this address.
<br/><br/><b>Optional Member Profile Information.</b> You can choose to provide us with additional optional information about yourself in your member profile, for example you can submit biographical information and a photo of yourself/your firm.
<br/><br/><b>Access To Your Personal Information.</b> In general, we make it easy for you to view the personally identifiable information we have collected from you in your member profile, where you can add, edit, or delete it as you see fit. 
<br/><br/><b>Information Submitted During A Transaction.</b> During a payment transaction (for example, when you pay for a project or get paid), we collect information including your name, bank account number, email address and telephone number. This information is collected and used to process your payment transaction.
<br/><br/><b>2. Information We Track.</b>
<br/><br/><b>Log Files.</b> Similar to many websites, we gather certain anonymous, non-personal information automatically and store it in web server log files. This information includes internet protocol addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), site entry/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to improve our site, analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements around the site, and gather aggregate information about our user base as a whole and therefore does not include your personally identifiable information.

We have no access to or control over these cookies, and, as noted above, this privacy policy does not govern the use of cookies by our business partners or advertisers.
